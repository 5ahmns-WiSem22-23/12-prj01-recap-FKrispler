But beware: there's a thief named "Goaßmass Gierschlund Gerhard" who disguised himself as a phony Santa at the mall called "Forum" and devised a scheme to steal all the Goaßmass in Salzburg with the aid of the mall's security guard.
It's up to you to outwit him and prevent him from carrying out his evil plot.
